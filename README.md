# Henrys-Test-Repository
This repository contains the source code for the e-Invoicing test automation project at MBIE
To run this project you will require Eclipse, Selenium and a Java installation.
The configuration file will need your email address and log in password for Validex

Release note:
The program works by selecting a test file and validating the file in Validex.
The program assumes that the expected error has the same name as the test file.
The program returns a passed test if the error found has the same name as the test file.
